# Final-Project-Final-Version

Datasets and files related to my GOV1006 replication project of Troustine's *Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods* (2016).

This repo includes all files used to replicate the main results from "mainresults.do," Trounstine (2016)'s Stata file generating the main results and tables. An annotated version of this do file is included as "mainresults_annotated.do," which explains the original Stata commands in the "mainresults.do" file. 

Due to the large size of the datasets, they are not included in this repo. However, they can be downloaded via Harvard Dataverse [here.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/4LZXTY&version=1.2). The relevant datasets there are "racial_polarization_winners.dta" and "fin_seg.dta", which I refer to as the racial polarization and the financial segregation datasets throughout my paper, respectively.

The file "Burzillo_Trounstine_Replication.Rmd" contains the R markdown file used for all of the analyses including the replication and the extension. The Appendix section contains most of the replication code and extra analysis that was not included in the main section of the paper. 

The file "table_1.png" is a screenshot of the original table displaying the results of the models for the effects of residential segregation on political polarization from page 713 of @trounstine_segregation_2016.

# Final-Project-Final-Version

Datasets and files related to my GOV1006 replication project of Troustine's *Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods* (2016).

This repo includes all files used to replicate the main results from "mainresults.do," Trounstine (2016)'s Stata file generating its main results and tables. An annotated version of this do file is included as "mainresults_annotated.do," which explains the original Stata commands in the "mainresults.do" file. 

The folder "Trounstine_files" contains the "mainresults.do" file downloaded from [Harvard Dataverse.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/4LZXTY&version=1.2). It also contains the file "table_1.png," which is a screenshot of the original table on page 713 of Trounstine (2016) displaying the results of the models for the effects of residential segregation on political polarization.

Due to the large size of the datasets, they are not included in this repo. However, they can be downloaded via Harvard Dataverse [here.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/4LZXTY&version=1.2). The relevant datasets there are "racial_polarization_winners.dta" and "fin_seg.dta", which I refer to as the racial polarization and the financial segregation datasets throughout my paper, respectively.

The file "Burzillo_Trounstine_Replication.Rmd" contains the R markdown file used for all of the analyses including the replication and the extension. The Appendix section contains most of the replication code and extra analysis that was not included in the main section of the paper. 

Finally, the "final_proj_bib.bib" files contains the citation information for sources cited in this project.

# Readme for the Replication Project of Trounstine (2016)

This repo contains files related to my GOV1006 replication project of Troustine's *Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods* (2016). My final paper is included in pdf form as "Burzillo_Trounstine_Replication.pdf."

The folder "Trounstine_files" contains the "mainresults.do" file downloaded from [Harvard Dataverse.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/4LZXTY&version=1.2), which is Trounstine (2016)'s Stata file generating its main results and tables. It also contains the file "table_1.png," which is a screenshot of the original table on page 713 of Trounstine (2016) displaying the results of the models for the effects of residential segregation on political polarization.

Due to the large size of the datasets, they are not included in this repo. However, they can be easily downloaded via Harvard Dataverse [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/4LZXTY&version=1.2). The relevant datasets there are "racial_polarization_winners.dta" and "fin_seg.dta", which I refer to as the racial polarization and the financial segregation datasets throughout my paper, respectively.

This repo also includes all files used to replicate the main results from "mainresults.do." An annotated version of this do file is included as "mainresults_annotated.do," which explains the original Stata commands in the "mainresults.do" file. The file "Burzillo_Trounstine_Replication.Rmd" contains the R markdown file used for all of the analyses including the replication and the extension. The Appendix section of this document contains most of the replication code, which is based off of the original Stata code found in "mainresults.do" in the "Trounstine_files" folder, as well as extra analysis that was not included in the main section of the paper. The remaining replicaiton code is contained within the main section of the paper. 

Finally, the "final_proj_bib.bib" files contains the citation information for sources cited in this project.

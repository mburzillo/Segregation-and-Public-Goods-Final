# Abstract

@trounstine_segregation_2016 suggests that high levels of residential segregation are associated with increased political polarization and decreased public goods spending. In this analysis, I was able to successfully replicate @trounstine_segregation_2016’s main results. I then attempted to better deal with the large amounts of missing data in the datasets used in the original analysis by multiply imputing missing values and re-running the original models using the resulting multiply imputed datasets. My results suggest that segregation is associated with increased racial political polarization, although maybe not as strongly as Trounstine (2016) originally suggested. Furthermore, I find that Trounstine (2016)'s conclusion that increases in segregation are associated with decreases in public spending holds for large cities, but that diversity is a better explanatory factor for small cities.

# Introduction

|        There is a large degree of variation in public goods spending across local governments. As a result, many scholars have worked to determine what factors may lead to the underprovision of public goods. Research in the past has associated racial diversity or changes in levels of diversity with the underprovision of public goods [@baqir_public_1999; @hopkins_diversity_2009]. However, @trounstine_segregation_2016 argues that it is racial segregation, not diversity in and of itself, that results in the underprovision of public goods. Trounstine’s analysis consists of two main parts. First, she uses election and demographic data from 25 of America’s largest cities between 1990 and 2010 to run a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression with fixed effects for region and year and with random effects for cities in order to show that political polarization increases with segregation. Trounstine measures segregation with Theil's H Index, which measures the degree to which the diversity of a neighborhood differs from the diversity of an entire city. The second main part of Trounstine’s analysis looks at the ability of the Theil’s H Segregation Index to explain a variety of types of public expenditures by city using a sample of 2,637 cities with 13,742 city-year observations. Using linear regressions with fixed effects for cities and robust standard errors clustered by city, Trounstine finds a significant, negative relationship between segregation and public goods spending that is robust to the inclusion of a variety of relevant controls and an alternative specification in which the number of waterways is used as an instrument for segregation.

|        In this analysis, I first work to replicate the main results of @trounstine_segregation_2016 using R statistical software [@r]. The original data and Stata code made publically available by the author were downloaded via the Harvard Dataverse [@DVN/4LZXTY_2015]. I also make all of my code and analysis available on Github.^[ Link to my [Github repository](https://github.com/mburzillo/new_final_project) for this project.] I was successfully able to replicate the main results of @trounstine_segregation_2016 in R with the exception of some of the marginal analyses, which I was nevertheless able to replicate in Stata.

```


|        One concern with @trounstine_segregation_2016 is the exclusion of a large proportion of observations from the regression analysis due to missing data for some values, which substantially constrains the sample size. For example, the regression analysis in the main specification using the the original racial polarization dataset exludes %`r round((obs_rp - 91)/obs_rp * 100, 0)` of the observations, and the regression analysis in the main specification using the original financial segregation dataset excludes %`r round((obs_fin_seg - 13742)/ obs_fin_seg * 100, 0)` of observations. As an extension of @trounstine_segregation_2016, I impute missing values in the original data using the mice package in R, which generates multivariate imputations using chained equations [@mice]. Then, I use the multiply imputed datasets to re-estimate the original models, pooling the results to generate final pooled regression coefficients and parameters. 

|        Comparing the results of the original regressions and those done with the imputed data yields similar big picture results for the analyses concerning the relationship between political polarization and segregation. Like in @trounstine_segregation_2016, I find that segregation is positively associated with political polarization; however, the magnitude and significance of the effect has diminsihed slightly. For the second set of analyses conducted with the financial segregation data, my initial results for running the models with the imputed data differ significantly from @trounstine_segregation_2016, suggesting that diversity, not segregation, is the more robust explanatory factor in patterns of public goods spending across cities. Nevertheless, this is likely because the data imputation exercise led to the inclusion of a much larger percentage of small cities in the sample, which were perhaps inadvertently largely excluded in @trounstine_segregation_2016 due to the list-wise deletion of observations with missing values, which were more frequently found in the observations of small cities. To explore whether or not city size impacted the results, I divided the original sample into two groups, large and small cities, based on the 25,000 population cutoff used to define cities in @baqir_public_1999. Performing the data imputation exercise and re-running the models on these subsets revealed that for large cities, segregation was the most powerful explanatory variable for public goods spending and was associated with decreases in public spending, while for small cities, diversity remained the most powerful explanatory variable and was associated with increases in public spending.


# Literature Review

|        Despite some progress made towards racial equity in the U.S. on other fronts, residential racial segregation continues to be deeply entrenched in American society [@fischer_distinguishing_2004; @oliver_paradoxes_2010; @massey_american_1993]. Research suggests that this kind of segregation has political consequences, as political cleavages in segregated cities tend to have racial as well as spatial dimensions [@massey_american_1993]. Neighborhoods are often important actors within local politics because local governments provide many functions that are allocational in nature and concern geographical space [@trounstine_segregation_2016]. Thus, when local areas are composed of competing neighborhoods that are divided on racial lines as well as spacial lines, it is natural to expect higher degrees of racial polarization as a result. 

|        In order to understand what segregation is and why it is important as a political concept, it is critical to understand the literature on the effects of diversity at various geographic levels. Studying diversity can be somewhat difficult and confusing because its effects tend to differ by geographic level. On the neighborhood level, a lack of racial diversity has been associated with racial intolerance, resentment, and competition between racial groups [@oliver_paradoxes_2010]. Living within non-diverse or segregated neighborhoods has also been associated with holding negative stereotypes and perceptions about out groups [@eric_oliver_intergroup_2003]. As a result, non-diverese, homogeneous neighborhoods have been associated with increased racial tension and political polarization in comparison to integrated, diverse neighborhoods. However, at the city or metropolitan level, the opposite seems to be true: when considering larger geographic areas, diversity, not homogeneity, is correlated with racial tension, competition, prejudice, lower levels of cooperation, and lower spending on public goods [@oliver_paradoxes_2010; @baqir_public_1999; @hopkins_diversity_2009]. Considering these theories jointly would predict that the geographic areas most ripe for racial tension and competition will be those that are diverse overall, but have many homogeneous, non-diverse neighborhoods, meaning that while people of different races co-exist within a larger metropolitan area, they live separately within their own neighborhoods. This situation corresponds to @trounstine_segregation_2016's definition of a severely segregated city. The differing effects of diversity at the neighborhood versus the larger geographic level provide an argument for considering segregation as opposed to simply diversity in local politics because measures of segregation (such as the Theils's H Index used by @trounstine_segregation_2016) take into account the patterns of racial mixing at both the neighborhood and larger geographic level that, alltogether, are important in predicting whether a locality will be characterized by interracial cooperation or political polarization [@trounstine_segregation_2016; @oliver_paradoxes_2010; @bharathi_public_2018].

|        Political polarization along racial lines may lead to decreased public spending and goods provision because groups may have different preferences, which can make compromise hard, and because groups may preceive a disutility in out-groups' receiving public goods expenditure [@baqir_public_1999]. @einstein_divided_2012 found evidence that racial segregation predicts large political divisions at the metropolitan level and that these divisions can create a lack of willingness to compromise and collaborate on local policy problems. @trounstine_segregation_2016 finds similar results at the city level: that residential racial segregation is associated with both increased political division and decreased public spending. Thus, these authors suggest that it is the combination of homogenous neighborhoods within a much larger, diverse geographic area that can lead to increased political polarization and reduced public goods spending in local governments. 

|        More recently, some scholars have called this hypothesis and its importance into question. For example, @lee_ethnic_2018 finds evidence that larger inequalities within the political system favoring socially powerful groups, not local diversity patterns leading to decreased cooperation, may be a better explanation of failures in public goods provision in diverse areas. Others suggest that additional factors, such as income segregation, may be important confounding factors in public goods provision [@an_its_2018; @massey_american_1993]. @an_its_2018, for example, suggests that the more closely related income inequality is to racial inequality, the less investment is made in public goods, and that this interaction may be a better predictor of public goods spending patterns than measures of diversity. Given the active debate in the literature over the relationships between diversity, segregation, public goods spending, and other factors, it is increasingly important to re-examine previously reported findings as a means of robustness checks. 


# Replication

|        In this analysis, I was able to successfully replicate all of the main results from Trounstine (2016). The regression analysis was fully replicated in R. As an example, in Table 5, which is presented in the Appendix, I replicate Table 1 from page 713 of @trounstine_segregation_2016, which is also included as Figure 7 for comparison. I was unable to successfully replicate Trounstine (2016)’s marginal effects analyses and margins plots using R. There does not yet appear to be a publically available R package or function to calculate marginal or predicted effects or to generate margins plots from the complicated multi-level models employed in the original paper, and creating such functions was outside of the scope of this project. Nevertheless, these results were successfully replicated in Stata. 

|        There was one interesting outcome from my attempt to replicate the original Stata code in R. Due to the differences in R and Stata in dealing with missing values, the results of my first replication of the analyses using the financial segregation dataset were slightly different from the results in Stata presented in the original paper. Ultimately, I discovered that this discrepancy was due to differences in R and Stata in dealing with missing values during conditioning. In order to exclude cities from her analysis with only one census tract, Trounstine conditions her regressions in Stata such that the value for the number of census tracts is greater than one. In Stata, this does not remove missing values, whereas in R, it does. Since this variable is used only as a conditional filter and not as a regression variable (and thus, the observations with missing values for the number of census tracts are not dropped when running the regressions), Trounstine’s analysis includes 14 cities and 58 observations with missing values for census tracts in addition to cities with two or more census tracts. This is a potential oversight on the part of the author, and I would suggest also dropping observations with missing census tract data, or else imputing them given that the aim of her condition was to exclude cities without a sufficient number of census tracts. Nevertheless, when I tried dropping these values from the analysis as a robustness check, I found that the change in the sample led to negligible differences in the results, likely because these observations represent a very small proportion of the overall sample. 


# Extension


|        One concern with the original analysis in @trounstine_segregation_2016 is the large amount of missing data values in the original datasets. In general, because both R and Stata by default drop any observations with missing values for any of the variables used in a regression, the existence of missing values can lead to the exlcusion of a large portion of the data from the analysis and potentially bias the results if the data is not missing completely at random. A large amount of data is missing in both of the main datasets used in the analyses of @trounstine_segregation_2016. The main model specification using the racial polarization dataset exludes `r (obs_rp - 91)` of the original  `r obs_rp` observations, or  %`r round(100*(obs_rp - 91)/obs_rp,0)` of the data. Additionally, the main model specification using the financial segregation dataset excludes `r format(obs_fin_seg - 13742, big.mark = ",")` of the original `r format(obs_fin_seg, big.mark = ",")` observations, or %`r round(100*(obs_fin_seg - 13742)/ obs_fin_seg,0)` of observations from the original dataset. 

|        In an attempt to better deal with the problem of missing data in @trounstine_segregation_2016, I impute missing values in the original data using the mice package in R, which generates multivariate imputations using chained equations [@mice]. While there are a variety of different imputation methods that could have been employed, multiple imputation (such as the multiple multivariate imputations generated by mice) is desirable because instead of inputting a single value such as the mean for missing values, it instead uses the distribution of the available data to estimate multiple potential values for the missing values. As a result, multiple imputation helps to account for the uncertainty inherent in the imputation process and allows for the calculation of standard errors around estimators. This allows the researcher to more accurately assess the uncertainty of the analysis in general. 

|        Before performing the multiple imputations on the datasets, I first examined the missing data for patterns. To better understand any potential patterns in the missing data, I plotted the pattern of missingness and created a histogram showing the frequency of missing values for those variables with missing values in Figure 1 for the racial polarization data and in Figure 2 for the financial segregation data. Looking at Figure 1, the histogram shows that the dependent variable in the analysis, which denotes the largest vote split along racial lines, and the variable indicating whether or not the election had candidates of more than one race had by far the largest percentages of missing data, missing %`r round(sum(is.na(rp_impute$biggestsplit))/nrow(rp_impute)*100,0)` and  %`r round(sum(is.na(rp_impute$biracial))/nrow(rp_impute)*100,0)` of observations, respectively. From the plot on the right in Figure 1, we can see that approximately 42% of observations are complete, meaning they have no missing values. There seems to be a correspondence between missing a value for the largest vote split and missing a value for the biracial election indicator. There also seem to be about 2% of values for which most of the variables are missing. However, most observations are not missing more than 2-3 values. 


```{r rp_aggr_plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "This plot examines the pattern of missing data in the the original racial polarization dataset from Trounstine (2016).

|        In Figure 2, we can similarly observe the trends for the financial segregation dataset. In this dataset, there is a very high proportion of missing values for most of the variables.

In this dataset, there are also many more observations for which values are missing for multiple variables in comparison to the racial polarization dataset, as can be seen in the plot on the right in Figure 2.

```

|        Finding no clear patterns in the missingness of the data initially, I proceeded with the multiple imputations. For the racial polarization dataset, I performed multiple imputations with 20 iterations using mice(), while for the financial segregation dataset, I performed 5 iterations due to the large size of the dataset and computing limitations. A non-stochastic imputation method, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), was used instead of the default for the imputation for both datasets because of an error with matrix inversion caused by the data that prevented the use of the default method, Predictive Mean Matching. For the racial polarization dataset, I included all of the variables used in the analysis associated with the dataset and was able to impute all missing values. For the financial segregation dataset, however, I only imputed values for the main independent variable, the segregation index, and a few other variables, although all variables used in the regression analysis were included in the data subset input into the mice() function to inform the predictions. For those variables from the financial segregation dataset for which I did impute data, I was not able to impute all of the missing values. More of the data could not be imputed because of the very high proportion of missing values, the large size of the dataset in general, and computing and time constraints for this project. 

```{r rp_imputation, include = FALSE}

# Perform multiple imputations using the cart method. Because of the time it
# takes to run this function, I turned the results into a dataset to load in
# instead of re-running everytime.

```

```{r fp_imputations_original, include = FALSE}

# perform multiple imputations. We have the same issue here with the default method as with the previous dataset so we use CART. Additionally, because of the extremely large size of this dataset, we choose to only impute the variable H_citytract_NHW_i, as it is the most frequently missing variable and also out main independent variable. Just imputing this allows us to include way more observations in the regression than the original data despite the still large number of NAs overall. One concern here would be that if there was some reason that this variable was missing rather than other variables that only imputing this variable could lead to some bias in the results.

```


|        Before examining the results of Trounstine's model using the multiply imputed data, I first ran some diagnostic tests on the imputation results to make sure that everything ran as expected. First, I checked the convergence of the algorithm used within mice() by plotting the trace lines as a function of the number of iterations for each of the variables. Then, I visually inspected the distributions of the imputed data in comparison to the original data with density and strip plots. All of these checks suggested that the imputed values were within a plausible range of the data and that their distribution fit the underlying distribution of the data relatively well. The only cases in which there was some cause for concern were for some of the variables with very few missing values in the racial polarization dataset, such as the indicators for region.

|        Since the results of the diagnostic checks were promising, I next proceeded to re-estimate the original model using the multiply imputed datasets, pooling the results to produce final pooled regression coefficients and parameters. The results of the analysis of the racial polarization dataset using  @trounstine_segregation_2016's first model specification are presented in Table 1. The results of the model with the new dataset are slightly different compared to the original results from Trounstine (2016). With the imputed data, we now have a total of `r nrow(complete(rp_impute))` observations in our model compared to the original model, which had only 91 observations. Interestingly, while the sign of the coefficient on the main variable of interest, the Theil's H Segregation Index, is the same and the standard error has decreased slightly, the result has become statisically insignificant and the 95% confidence interval contains zero. Thus while these results still suggest that segregation may be associated with increased political polarization, they confer a lesser degree of certainty than Trounstine's original analysis. All coefficients are statistically insignificant except for the indicator for a biracial election, which remains significant, and  the indicator for a primary election, which has changed from being significant in the original analysis to being insignificant here. In general, the standard errors on the coefficients have decreased slightly.

|        For the second and third model specifications, which use the two-group Theil's H Segregation Index, the results were similar.

The other coefficients except for the biracial indicator are insignificant, and standard errors have reduced slightly in these specifications compared to the original analysis in Trounstine (2016). As a visual comparison of the model coefficients, I include coefficient plots for the diversity and segregation index variables as Figure 4. From this plot, it is clear that across all of the models, the coefficient on diversity is positive and insignificant, while the coefficient on the segregaiton index is positive and, in most cases, significant.

The regression also includes fixed effects for year and region and random effects for cities (geo_id2). Diversity is  included because of the claim that more diverse populations will have more heterogeneous political preferences. The other fixed effect control variables are included because they are known to be potentially correlated with segregation. winner == 1 requires that there was a winner in the election.

|        For the financial segregation dataset, I similarly fit each of our 5 imputed datasets to the original models from @trounstine_segregation_2016 and then pooled the results for each. As a result of the imputation process, I was able to include an additional `r format(73119 - 13742, big.mark = ",")` observations in the analysis, increasing the sample size by %`r round((73119 - 13742)/ 13742*100,0)`. While this is an improvement, I was unable to impute all of the missing values because of the large percentage of missing values in the original dataset, which limited the performance of the algorithm, and due to time and computing constraints for this project.

|        The results of the first specification of model using the multiply imputed financial segregation data present a stark difference from the results of @trounstine_segregation_2016. Crucially, the effect size of the segregation index on public spending has essentially gone to zero and become statistically insignificant. Interestingly, the coefficient on the diversity variable has increased substantially from .106 to `r round(imp_felm1_sum[2,2], 3)` and has become statistically significant. The results of the second and third specifications were similar, with the coefficient on segregation going almost to zero and becoming insignificant on both. For brevity, the results of the second and third specifications are not presented, but they are available in the Appendix on GitHub.

|        Because these results differed to such a degree from @trounstine_segregation_2016's original findings, I performed some checks on the data included in each analysis. I discovered that @trounstine_segregation_2016 excluded most cities below a certain population size because of the nature of the paper's list-wise deletion of observations containing missing values: as small cities were more likely to be missing data, it seems that they were inadvertently and disproportionately dropped from @trounstine_segregation_2016's regression analysis. Given this development, I decided to test whether or not city population size affected the results. Making use of the population cutoff of at least 25,000 people used to define cities in @baqir_public_1999, I divided the orginal sample into cities having populations above and below 25,000 people. I then again imputed missing values for each and used the multiply imputed datasets in re-runs of Trounstine's original models. 


|        Before discussing the results of these two additional analyses, I first illustrate the differences in the city population sizes for the observations used in the various analyses in Figure 5, which displays the population distributions of the samples used in each. The figure makes it clear that the observations included in @trounstine_segregation_2016's original analysis were not representative of the original data sample with the missing values, as most of the cities with lower populations were excluded as a result of the list-wise data deletion. While the dataset generated from the data imputation on the whole sample also has a different distribution for city populaiton, the range of the data seems to be much more representative of the overall data range in comparison to the @trounstine_segregation_2016 sample. In the plot, I also include the distributions of city population size of the multiply imputed datasets above and below the 25,000 population cutoff. For cities above the cutoff, the city population distribution is similar to the distribution in @trounstine_segregation_2016.

## regression 1 Table 2

# The following is a fixed effects model regression with clustering around
# geo_id2. It mandates that total census tracts in the city is greater than 1,
# which we want because our measure of evenness of racial spread is constant for
# cities with only one tract by our definition (which requires comparing tracts
# within cities). It also mandates that Direct General Expenditures (DGE) per
# capita, CPI adjusted is not equal to 0, which would be problematic and
# indicate a potential data error. This regression regresses the DGE per capita
# on the the two-group calculation of  Theil's H interpolated. Controls are
# included for diversity and the % populations of Blacks, Asians, and Latinos to
# help identify whether it is actually diversity that drives down spending.These
# demographic controls also help to account for the fact that whites and
# minorities tend to perfer different levels of government spending in general.
# This will help isolate the effects of segregation v. other forms of diversity
# on public spending. Other controls for Median household income, CPI adjusted,
# percent over 65, percent college grads, percent local government workers, log
# population help control for additional factors related to segregation and
# expenditure. Controls for percent renters interpolated and Median household
# income also help to control for the general wealth of cities, which could be a
# potential driver of public spending. Fixed effects for cities are also
# included  so that the author can examine the effect of segregation in the same
# city over  time, which also helps control for many other factors not otherwise
# taken into account (such as city age)

|        As a summary of all of the model results for the two main coefficients of interest, segregation index and diversity, a coefficient plot is presented as Figure 6, with the models ordered by increasing median log population size of the sample on the x-axis. Looking first at the coefficients for diversity, the two models with low median city population size have significant, positive coefficients, while the models with the larger median city populations have insignificant coefficients. This suggestst that diversity is an important estimator of public goods spending for small, but not necessarily for large, cities. Next, looking at the plot for the segregation index, we see the oppposite effect. For the models where the median city population sizes were small, the coefficient on segregation is insignificant. However, for the two models with larger median city populations, the coefficients are significant and negative. This suggests that for small cities, segregation is not a very good estimator of public goods spending, but when cities are larger, increases in a city's segregation index are associated with decreases in public goods spending.

# Conclusion

|        Why cities differ in their amount of spending on public goods is an interesting question that is frequently debated in the literature. @trounstine_segregation_2016 posits that segregation may be an important underlying cause of the underprovsion of public goods. Finding evidence that residential segregation by race increases political partisanship, @trounstine_segregation_2016 argues that residential segregation can increase division and make cooperation amongst competing groups difficult, which results in decreased spending on public goods. The findings of @trounstine_segregation_2016 are particularly important because they suggest that segregation, as defined by many homogeneous neighborhoods within a larger, diverse geographical area, is the key factor in disinvestment in public goods. This contradicts previous research which has suggested that levels of diversity were instead most important (see for example @baqir_public_1999 or @hopkins_diversity_2009).

|        In this paper, I first worked to provide a check on the analysis presented in @trounstine_segregation_2016 by attempting to replicate the work in R. I was able to successfully replicate all of the main results, with the exception of the marginal analyses of the complex, multi-level models which, to my knowledge, are currently not supported by available R packages or functions. I was, however, able to successfully replicate these results in Stata.

|        I then tested the models in @trounstine_segregation_2016 by re-running them with additional data that I imputed from missing values in the original datasets. The large number of missing values in both of the datasets used in @trounstine_segregation_2016's main analysis created a concern for potential bias in the original results because observations with missing values were automatically excluded from the regression analysis. Using the mice package in R, I created multiply imputed datasets, upon which I re-ran the models and pooled the results to generate the final model coefficients and parameters. 

|        The results of the data imputation exercise differed between the two datasets. For the analyses using the smaller, racial polarization dataset, re-running the models with the imputed data resulted in a smaller magnitude of the coefficient on the segregation index, and also made it statistically insignificant in the main model specification. This suggests that segregation is still positively associated with political polarization, but maybe not quite as strongly as @trounstine_segregation_2016 suggests.

|        On the other hand, for the analyses using the much larger financial segregation dataset, the results of the models using the multiply imputed data sharply contrasted the results of @trounstine_segregation_2016, suggesting that diversity, and not segregation, was the best explanatory variable for public goods spending across all cities. While these results originally seemed quite contradictory to @trounstine_segregation_2016, I was able reconcile this finding by discovering that the results of @trounstine_segregation_2016 seem to be representative only of larger cities. By dropping all observations in the original data with missing values for variables included in the regressions, it seems that @trounstine_segregation_2016 inadvertently restricted their sample to almost entirely larger cities (above 25,000 residents) whereas the full sample consisted of cities that had smaller populations on average. To test the hypothesis that diversity is more important for predicting public goods spending for small cities while segregation is more important for predicting public goods spending for larger cities, I divided the original dataset into two subsets of cities with populations above and below 25,000 people. I then multiply imputed the missing values for each data subset and re-ran the models. I found that the results presented initial evidence in support of my hypothesis. For the cities below the 25,000 person population cutoff, the coefficient for diversity was positive and significant while the coefficient for the segregation index was insignificant. For cities above the 25,000 person cutoff, the results were very similar to the results found in @trounstine_segregation_2016: the coefficient for diversity was insignificant, but the coefficient for the segregation index was significant and negative. 

|        The replication exercise and the robustness check of @trounstine_segregation_2016's models using multiply imputed data provide evidence that residential racial segregation is associated with political polarization. Furthermore, I find evidence that supports the finding of @trounstine_segregation_2016 that increases in segregation are associated with decreases in public goods spending; however, I find that this is only the case for larger cities. For small cities, I find that diversity, not segregation, seems to be the most important explanatory variable for public goods spending. One potential explanation for why segregation does not seem to meaningfully explain public expenditures for small cities is that, when cities become too small, segregation becomes difficult to maintain. The sort of segregation by neighborhood described in @trounstine_segregation_2016 as a diverse city broken down into homogenous, segregated neighborhoods requires that multiple neighborhoods exist and have the space to be separated geographically. When city population sizes are small, this may not be feasible, and interracial interactions may become more common. As a result, an increase in diversity may be associated with a larger degree of integration and increased interracial contact within a small city, just as the literature expects would happen on the neighborhood level (Oliver 2010).  This explanation makes sense in the context of the fact that the coefficient on diversity was positive for small cities in my model, indicating that an increase in diversity in small cities was associated with an increase in public spending, perhaps due to this absence of racial polarization. Given the very small size of most "cities" in the original datasets in @trounstine_segregation_2016, I might even argue that these political entities would be more productively considered as "towns" or "neighborhoods," given that the overall median city population in the financial segregation dataset was a mere `r median(fin_seg$population)`. 

|        The underprovision of public goods may inhibit social mobility and unfairly disadvantage certain groups. @trounstine_segregation_2016 has identified an important relationship between segregation and the provision of public goods, which I suggest holds for larger cities, but not necessarily for smaller ones. Given the evidence presented here that the importance of segregation and diversity as predictors of the underprovision of public goods may differ based on city size, further research is needed to assess the nuance of these relationships. For example, at what city size or population does segregation become more relevant than diversity? And what implications does this have for how public policy should be designed and implemented to address these issues? In answering some of these questions, we may be able to improve our ability to identify, understand, and address the root causes of the underprovision of public goods.

They also mandate that the highways per capita, CPI adjsuted with no cap extend (lagged 5 years) is not equal to 0, which would be problematic and indicate a potential data error. The dependent variable here is highways per capita, CPI adjsuted with no cap extend (lagged 5 years) and it is regressed on the two group calculation of Theil's H, interpolated. Controls are added for diversity, percent population of Blacks, Asians, and Latinos, and median household CPI adjusted income as well as for % local government worker hundreds, percent rentership, percent over 65, percent college graduates, and the log of the population. This essentially examines the effect of segregation on the specific public good of highways. As in the previous table's regressions, fixed effects for cities are also included so that the author can examine the effect of segregation in the same city over time, which also helps control for many other factors not otherwise taken into account (such as city age) *

## regression 1 Table 5

# Top Row

# Column 1

# This is an instrumental variable regression with DGE per capita, adjusted by the CPI, as the dependent variable and total number of waterways as the instrumental variable for segregation. The instrument includes the log of the population in the first stage because the number of waterways is positively correlated to population and population is positively correlated with segregation. The control variables are the same as those in the regressions for Table 2 except for 2 changes: since the number of waterways does not change, there is no need for city fixed effects. Instead, we include fixed effects for the region and year. A lagged version of the dependent variable (dgepercap_cpilag) is added to the regressions to account for the high correlation between  observations for the same city over time and because changes in local budgets typically are incremental (NOTE: why exactly do we do this/why does it help/why not do it in the non-intstrumental regressions?).
